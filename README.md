# My Little Master [WIP]
 
This game is a **work in progress** and is being made in collaboration between @snoozleEmily and @jluizcalonio. It is sill in the MVP creation phase.

## What is it about?

A narrative-driven game where player choices shape the story and influence the world. [WIP]

## Gameplay

Details about gameplay will be explained here. [WIP]

## Contributing

**Contributions are welcome!** Below are some guidelines to help you get started:

1. New story content should be added in JSON and the logic in Jinja2.

    ### Why Jinja2 Is Being Used  

    #### Dynamic Storytelling: 
    Jinja2 allows story text to change based on player choices, making the narrative more engaging.  

    #### Less Repetitive:
    The templates prevent duplicate story text, making content easier to manage and expand. Additionally, the chapters follow the same structure, which helps streamline development.

    #### Easier to Localize:
    Switching languages is simple without altering the game logic.
    We plan to add support for Portuguese and, hopefully, Spanish in the future.

    #### Flexible & Clean Code:
    Jinja2 supports conditionals and variables to adapt text based on gameplay, making it easier to add more conditions and actions as the game evolves. Reusable story components and dynamic text make the code easier to maintain.

    #### Easier To Scale & Maintain:
    Templates reduce redundancy and simplify updates as the game grows, allowing for easier expansion without complicating the codebase.

2. Choices System [WIP]
