## Gameplay

## Contributing

**Contributions are welcome!** Below are some guidelines to help you get started:

1. New story content should be added in JSON and the logic in Jinja2.

    ### Why Jinja2 Is Being Used  

    #### More Flexible  
    The text generation is dynamic and based on player choices, which is the basis of the game.  

    #### Less Repetitive  
    The templates prevent duplicate story text, making content easier to manage and expand. Not to mention that the chapters follow the same structure, therefore...  

    #### Easier to Localize  
    Switching languages is simple without changing game logic.  
    We plan to do this in the future, most likely in Portuguese and hopefully in Spanish.  

    #### More Dynamic  
    It supports conditionals and variables to adapt text to gameplay, making it easier to add more conditions and specific actions in the future.  

    #### Easier Scalability  
    It's easier to expand the game without complicating the codebase.  

2. Choices System [WIP]
