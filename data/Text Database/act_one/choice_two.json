    "question": "Tak Tak tilts his head. 'A flesh-bag thinks to serve the Unyielding Forge?' Ash falls from his reconstructed body as he leans closer. Now you can clearly understand what the old writings said: He has piercing eyes of an angel but the comfortless smile of a demon. His sour breath behind your neck catches your attention. 'Speak. Why should I not grind your bones for mortar? Why should I allow you small fly to adore holy Abend?'",

          "id_1": "You try to object against the spell, but Tak Tak's eyes glow with hellish devotion. The world twists violently, depositing you in an enormous cave reeking of decay. Glowing symbols burn across your skin. You must fulfill your purpose or die at your new master's hands.",
          "id_2": "Your bones crackle and blood boils as reality warps around you. You awaken in a gargantuan ancient cavern, your body reformed into something... different. Survival now depends on completing Tak Tak's trial.",
          "id_3": "An icy force lifts you off the ground before violently dragging you underwater. You emerge gasping in a subterranean lake, its black waters contained within an icy grotto. The cave offers no mercy - succeed or perish."

        "adventure_setup": {
          "id_1": "The path to the eastern cave winds through blighted lands. After weeks of travel, you squeeze through a narrow fissure into a cavern where despair hangs thick as fog. The obsidian lake beckons.",
          "id_2": "Though you know not where to search, your feet move with unnatural certainty. Months pass in a haze until you stand before the legendary black lake, its surface still as death.",
          "id_3": "The cave finds you more than you find it. One morning you awaken at its mouth, your supplies exhausted but body compelled forward. The lake's dark waters ripple without wind."

          "id_1": "Tak Tak's laughter echoes as you study the disintegrating map. Weeks of deciphering lead to a coastal cave system where tide and stone conspire against you. The sand glitters treacherously underfoot.",
          "id_2": "The map's shifting markings lead you on a maddening chase. After losing all sense of time, you stumble into a cavern where the walls themselves seem to breathe. Strange sands coat every surface.",
          "id_3": "Your defiance grows with each step, yet the compulsion remains. The final cavern reveals itself at moonless midnight - a glittering beach under stone sky, the sand singing with trapped memories."
