  // Refactoring:

  In a dark room, you find yourself lost in your thoughts, wondering about the past.
  You know that you need to go after what you want—or you'll get into big trouble.
  You've tried doctors, priests, magicians, and even shamans, but nothing seems to work.
  You've been told that you were cursed at birth, and your life only seems to grow more cursed along the way.
  Then, you hear about a cult called "The Black Cat"—people who might help you with your curse. 
  They worship black cats, creatures said to be cursed since birth, just like you.
  One day, while trying (and failing) to get a job at a bar—your curse makes you unwanted anywhere—a tall man approaches you. He's dressed in a long black coat, white shoes, and silver earrings, with a thick Scottish accent.
  “I can see ye're marked by the undead Gods,” he says. “Yer bloodline… it's no' ordinary.”
  Somehow, you know he means well. And against all reason, you want to believe him.
