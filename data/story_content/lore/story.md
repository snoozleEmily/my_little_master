# The Twelve Gods
*"And so it was written in the annals of the ancients, that twelve great gods reigned over the fates of men, unseen but ever present, their will shaping the course of the world. Their names are whispered still, carried on the winds of forgotten tongues, etched into stone where only the dust of time may read them. And those who served them, their faithful servants, carried out their will with unwavering devotion. To know their names is to glimpse the fabric of existence itself…"*

## Abend Diabolos Pwuhn, the Unyielding Forge
It was he who shaped the world with hammer and toil, the god of labor, craftsmanship, and perseverance. His seven austere servants, silent and disciplined, ensured that the world remained steadfast, that kingdoms did not crumble, that bridges held, that men endured. No storm nor war could break his will, and no plea could break his strength.

## Bastet Chiusa, Keeper of Hearth and Throne
The gentle hand of divinity, she watched over homes and rulers alike. Her presence was a comfort, her blessing a shield. The pharaohs of old swore by her name, and in their halls, her likeness stood in places of honor. With three gentle attendants at her side, she soothed weary hearts and guarded the fires that burned in every dwelling.

## Picking Thoth, Lord of Fire
From his hands spilled the first sparks of wisdom, the first abstractions, the first choices. He was the god of fire—not the flame that consumes, but the fire that illuminates, transforms, and inspires. His eleven devoted servants, living flames of intellect, whispered riddles and truths to mortals, guiding them through the labyrinth of thought. He was the patron of scholars, philosophers, and those who sought to burn away ignorance.

## Nika Ra Dev, the Unbound Sun
He rode the heavens in his blazing chariot, the god of the sun and freedom. His light was not bound by rules or chains; it was the embodiment of unchained potential, of rebellion against oppression. His two loyal servants, the Twin Flames, carried his will across the heavens, igniting revolutions and scorching tyranny. Nika was the sun that refused to set, the light that defied all darkness.

## Eliaeb Esecuz, The Faceless One
A god with no temple, no effigy, no known domain—yet whose presence was undeniable. The shapeshifter, the ever-changing. He is the god of races, breeds, ancestry, lineage, and forgotten bloodlines, whispering through the veins of all beings, seen and unseen. His form is never the same twice; to gaze upon him is to see a reflection of what one fears, what one admires, or what one might become.

His eight skinwalker servants prowl the edges of existence, slipping between shapes, borrowing faces, speaking in the tongues of the lost. They move in silence, carrying out the will of a master who has no true form, no true name—only a presence that lingers, a shadow cast by a light unseen.

## Hathor Nuwa Sequel, the Radiant Muse
Where she walked, laughter followed. Where she danced, hearts grew light. Goddess of love, beauty, music, dance, fertility, and pleasure—she was the guardian of joy itself, the whisper in a lover’s ear, the beat of a drum in celebration. Her four servants, ever smiling, spread mirth where there was sorrow, harmony where there was discord.

## Sedah Ulink, the Judge of the Departed
All things must end, and it is he who watches the threshold between life and death. Sedah Ulink, the feared god of the afterlife, ruler of the underworld, and guardian of graves. His nine akuma servants moved unseen, carrying out his will without question, ensuring that the dead found their rightful place—whether in light or in shadow.

## Abraxas Wa Attesa, the Twin-Edged Scale
Order and chaos, creation and destruction, fate and free will—he was the god of paradoxes, the keeper of the delicate balance between opposing forces. His five servants were split—two enforcers of structure, three agents of entropy. Together, they ensured that neither order nor chaos tipped the scales too far.

## Rath Re Ply, the Keeper of Secrets
Hidden knowledge, mysteries, and forbidden truths were his domain. Rath Re Ply was the patron of spies, scholars, and those who sought to uncover what was meant to stay buried. His two servants, the Veiled Twins, hoarded secrets and revealed them only to the worthy—or the desperate.

## Ymir Yoodeesee, the Weaver of Chronology
Through her hands slipped the strands of fate. The goddess of time, destiny, and eternity, she was the unseen clock that marked the passage of all things. Her breath was the whisper of the ages, her footsteps the ticking of the unseen clock. Deja vu, the strange echo of things that have already been, was her gift—a glitch in time’s tapestry, allowing mortals to glimpse parallel paths. Her eternal servant, the Echo, walked beside her, replaying fragments of the past and future.

## Mireuk Veepee En, the Unshackled Wrath
Where he stepped, ruin followed. War, destruction, madness—these were his gifts, and none who invoked his name did so lightly. His six uncanny servants bore different faces of chaos: plague, war, betrayal, fire, storm, and terror. He did not command them, for they were forces that could not be ruled—only unleashed.

## Nami Delibera, Mistress of the Tides
Her voice was the crash of waves, her breath the howling of the wind. Goddess of the seas, weather, and guidance, her reach was vast and untamable. Though the ocean was ever shifting, her thirty-three harmonious servants worked tirelessly to bring balance to the restless waters, ensuring that chaos never fully consumed the world.
